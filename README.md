INSTRUCTIONS:

Arrays allow you to assign multiple values to one variable. For this PHP exercise,
write an array variable of weather conditions with the following values: 
( rain, sunshine, clouds, hail, sleet, snow, wind. )

Using the array variable for all the
weather conditions, echo the following statement to the browser:

"We've seen all kinds of weather this month. At the beginning of the month, we had
snow and wind. Then came sunshine with a few clouds and some rain. At least we
didn't get any hail or sleet."

Don't forget to include a title for your page, both in the header and on the page itself.
